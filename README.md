FOR TF's Only:

-Everything is already going to be pre-installed with the vagrant box
-All you need to do is run the follow the next steps:

	1) Install VMWare if you do not have it
	2) Install vagrant with your
		https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html
	3) open terminal/bash shell
	3) cd into root /universityknowledge directory
	4) run "vagrant up" once in directory
	5) wallah! go to 192.168.33.10 and it's up!

 
- Just in case, I dumped the SQL file in the root directory, called localhost.sql
	-mysql database username and password are both "root"

-phpmyadmin is installed, so you can go to 192.168.33.10/phpmyadmin
